# RoutingAngularJS
An exercise which was given to me as part of my education on web development. Goal: routing trhough multiple pages with AngularJS without the need to reload the whole page. I've created one main file which I use as a base for displying another three files with different content and styling. I'm using XAMPP to play like a virtual server for I do not use a real one yet.
